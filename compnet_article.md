Title = TCP & UDP, comparing the two computer network terms

Subtitle = When to choose each and why it matters

My first article of 2026:)

Recently, I have been preparing for my university exam subject, computer networks. During it, I encountered a topic I found interesting, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 

As this two terms are among the most crucial terms of computer network, this article will try to discuss the two, from my learning perspective. 

**Section 1 = General idea and fundamental difference*

* address which layer tcp and udp belongs to, some basic knowledge of computer network
* explain in analogy = registered letter vs postcard

Lets start by understanding the context information, what is essentially going on. So in computer networks, we have the activity of information being send from one end to another. The subject of computer network studies how these 'information' in the form of data packets travels through different network layers. 

**Section 2 = TCP deep dive*

* Three way handshake and why it matters
* how retransmission works
* Flow control
* Congestion control

**Section 3 = UDP deep dive*

* No setup overhead or handshake
* Difference in packet structure
* Checksum for error detection
* best effort delivery

**Section 4 = Real world implementation*

* Video streaming = uses udp
* online games = uses udp
* 

**Section 5 = When to use each of them*

**Section 6 = Conclusion*

Hopefully, this article could help potential readers to prepare for their computer network exams, as it did for me.
